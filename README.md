## Language

The project is developed using Kotlin, and the codebase follows the [Kotlin Coding Standards](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) for maintainability.

# Libraries

- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): Dependency injection library for Android.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room): A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.

- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines): Kotlin's coroutine support for asynchronous and concurrent programming, enhancing the efficiency of background tasks and network operations.

## Architecture

The project follows the [MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/intro) architecture pattern to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase. Key architectural components include:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: Displays the user interface and observes changes in the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel**: Manages the UI-related data and business logic, communicates with the Model, and updates the View.
